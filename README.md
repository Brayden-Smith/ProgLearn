# ProgLearn

### About the Project

**ProgLearn** is a passion project created by two friends looking to take on a meaningful challenge in the world of machine learning. Unlike most ML libraries that rely heavily on pre-existing packages, ProgLearn seeks to start from scratch by building out core concepts—like linear algebra and complex numbers—layer by layer to develop a deeper understanding of the math and mechanics behind machine learning algorithms.

### Why We Built It

Our goal with ProgLearn is to demystify machine learning from the ground up. By implementing foundational components ourselves, we aim to gain insight into the building blocks of machine learning, which will not only enhance our understanding but also provide a custom, lightweight library for experimentation.

### Key Achievements So Far

- **Eigenfaces Algorithm**: Successfully implemented this classic facial recognition algorithm, which identifies key features in face images and represents them in a lower-dimensional space.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Currently in progress—developing a working SVM model to classify data based on optimal hyperplanes.

### Tech Stack

- **Core Components**: Implemented basic linear algebra operations and complex numbers from scratch.
- **Languages**: The library is primarily written in Python, leveraging minimal dependencies to maximize custom code implementation.

### Example: Eigenfaces Algorithm

Here’s an example output from the Eigenfaces algorithm, showing how ProgLearn can identify and represent facial features:

### How It Works

1. **Starting from Basics**: We’re implementing core math functions to ensure the library has a strong foundation, including our own matrix operations and complex number handling.
2. **Building Upward**: With the fundamentals in place, we’re adding advanced models like Eigenfaces and SVMs that rely on these underlying structures.
3. **Testing and Refining**: Each model is carefully tested with sample data to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### What We’re Learning

ProgLearn has taught us about the complex interplay between mathematics and machine learning, pushing us to understand not just how algorithms work but why. Building from the bottom up has been challenging but rewarding, especially as we see our hard work come to life in real implementations.

### Future Plans

- **Expand Model Library**: Develop additional ML models like decision trees and neural networks, entirely built on top of our foundational components.
- **Optimize Performance**: As our library grows, we’re planning to improve the efficiency of our linear algebra functions for better performance.
- **Documentation & Examples**: Create detailed documentation and example notebooks for each algorithm to showcase usage.

### About Us

We’re two friends who are passionate about both math and machine learning. ProgLearn has been our way of challenging ourselves and building something from scratch, one line of code at a time. We’re excited to keep pushing the project forward and sharing what we learn along the way.
